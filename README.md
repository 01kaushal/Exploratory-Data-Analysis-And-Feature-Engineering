Techniques to Handle Missing Values in Numerical and Categorical Data
Handling missing data is a crucial part of the data preprocessing phase in any data science or machine learning project. Choosing the right technique to handle missing values can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models and ensure the accuracy of your results.

Handling Missing Values in Numerical Data
Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:

Mean: Replace missing values with the mean of the feature.
Median: Use the median if the data is skewed or contains outliers.
Mode: Replace missing values with the most frequent value (for categorical-like numerical data).
Random Sample Imputation:

Fill missing values by randomly sampling from the non-missing values of the feature. This helps preserve the distribution of the data.
End of Distribution Imputation:

Replace missing values with extreme values such as the minimum or maximum value from the distribution.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:

Use the KNN algorithm to impute missing values based on the values of the nearest neighbors. This technique works well when there are relationships between features.
Regression Imputation:

Build a regression model to predict the missing values based on other available features. This method assumes a linear relationship between features.
Multiple Imputation:

Create multiple imputations (replacing missing values multiple times) to account for uncertainty in missing data, often used in more advanced statistical analyses.
Predictive Imputation:

Use machine learning models (such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict missing values based on the other observed data.
Handling Missing Values in Categorical Data
Mode Imputation:

Replace missing values with the mode (the most frequent category) in the dataset. This is the most common approach for categorical data.
Create a New Category:

Introduce a new category (e.g., Unknown or Missing) to represent missing values. This is especially useful when the missingness carries meaning.
Frequent Categories Imputation:

Replace missing values with the most frequent category, maintaining the distribution of the categorical feature.
Random Category Imputation:

Impute missing values by randomly sampling from the observed categories. This can be useful if there is no clear mode or if the data is not heavily skewed.
Predictive Imputation:

Similar to regression imputation, use classification models (e.g., decision trees or logistic regression) to predict the missing categories based on other features.
Hot Deck Imputation:

Impute missing values by randomly sampling from a similar group or subset of data that is observed.
Advanced Imputation Techniques (For Both Numerical and Categorical Data)
Iterative Imputation:

An iterative process that models each feature with missing values as a function of other features, and then uses that model to predict missing values, repeatedly.
Matrix Factorization:

Decompose the data matrix into lower-rank matrices to infer missing values, often used in collaborative filtering and recommender systems.
Deep Learning-Based Imputation:

Use neural networks (e.g., autoencoders) to learn the data distribution and impute missing values in both numerical and categorical data.
Considerations when Handling Missing Data:
Type of Data: Numerical and categorical features require different techniques.
Amount of Missing Data: If a significant portion of data is missing, simple imputation techniques might not work well. In such cases, more sophisticated methods like predictive imputation or deep learning imputation can be useful.
Pattern of Missing Data: Check whether data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), or Not Missing at Random (NMAR). This will help you choose the most appropriate imputation method.
Impact on Model Performance: Always validate the performance of your models after applying imputation techniques to ensure you're not introducing bias.
